## Problems with the dataset

The first problem we have faced was the extension of the IMDb database. It is composed of **.list** files which cannot be read and transformed as normal **.csv** files. For the purpose of this exercise we used a subset of movies from IMDb, downloaded from the personal page of one of us, which contains only few variables and few observation.

---

## Import and data cleansing

``` {r 1.1, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Set working directory
setwd("/Users/mariocatuogno/Dropbox/Github/IMDb")
## Import raw data [Package: readr]
raw_data <- read_csv("data/raw_data.csv")
```

The "**raw_data**" dataset, downloaded from IMDb, weights **113KB** and has **526 observation** and **16 variables**. We decided to cleanse the dataset because there were some variables with NAs and others that cannot be used for analysis (e.g. URL variable).

``` {r 1.2, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Select only "Feature Film" discarding "TV Series" [Package: dplyr]
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  tbl_df %>%
  filter(`Title type` == "Feature Film")
## Select and rename columns [Package: dplyr]
raw_data <- raw_data %>%
  select(movie_id = const,
         movie_title = Title,
         movie_genre = Genres,
         movie_runtime = `Runtime (mins)`,
         movie_year = Year,
         date_release = `Release Date (month/day/year)`,
         cast_director = Directors,
         rating_personal = `You rated`,
         rating_IMDb = `IMDb Rating`,
         num_votes = `Num. Votes`)
## Select only the first movie genre as main genre, deleting secondary genres
raw_data$movie_genre <- gsub(".*,", "", raw_data$movie_genre)
## Select only the first director as main director, deleting secondary directors
raw_data$cast_director <- gsub(".*,", "", raw_data$cast_director)
```

Then we started the cleansing of the raw dataset. The **raw_data** contained both movies and TVshows, so we decided to consider only movies, deleting TVshows records. The following step was to clean the dataset renaming each variable (*there were some variables with spaces in the name and some with only NA*) and selecting only the ones useful for our project.

`movie_genre` and `cast_director` contained more than one value, so we decided to use only the first argument, using the `gsub()` function. In this way we have only one movie genre and one director for each movie.

``` {r 1.3, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## Save the newly created dataset, to speedup the import process [Package: readr]
write_csv(raw_data, "data/clean_data.csv")
```

Once finished the cleansing process (*the dataset was already clean*), we saved the data frame into a new **.csv** file in order to speed up the importing process.

## Data exploration

``` {r 2.1, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
## Set working directory
setwd("/Users/mariocatuogno/Dropbox/Github/IMDb")
## Import cleansed data
data <- read.csv("data/clean_data.csv")
## Check the structure of the dataset
str(data)
```

For further analysis and exploration we have used the cleansed dataset. Above there is the structure of the data frame. The newly cleansed dataset weights **42KB** and has **507 observation** and **10 variables**.

``` {r 2.2, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
```

## Data visualization

```{r 3.1, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Create data frame with frequencies for each movie genre
movie_genre <- c("Action", "Adventure", "Crime", "Drama", "Comedy", "Family",   
                 "Fantasy", "History", "Horror", "Musical", "Mystery", "Romance", 
                 "SciFi", "Sport", "Thriller", "War", "Western")
movie_freq <- c(2, 11, 11, 46, 22, 20, 
                53, 1, 4, 4, 15, 53, 
                76, 10, 151, 19, 9)
movie_genre_freq <- data.frame(movie_genre, movie_freq)
rm(movie_genre, movie_freq)
```

`ggplot` has some problem with the reordering of levels of a factor. For that reason we have created a data frame with the frequencies for each movie genres (*movies seen of that specific genre*). 

```{r 3.2, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# Arrange levels of factor by frequency
movie_genre_freq$movie_genre <- factor(movie_genre_freq$movie_genre, levels = movie_genre_freq$movie_genre[order(movie_genre_freq$movie_freq)])
```

In order to plot the frequencies in descending order, was necessary to sort the levels of the factor, based on the frequency.

```{r 3.3, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
## P1: Number of movies by genre
p1 <- ggplot(data = movie_genre_freq, aes(x = movie_genre, y = movie_freq, label = movie_freq, fill = movie_genre)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + geom_text(nudge_y = 4.5) + coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Count", y = "Movie genre", title = "Number of movies by genre") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none", 
        legend.text = element_text(face = "italic", size = 10),
        legend.title = element_blank())
plot(p1)
```

From this plot we can see that the most seen movie genre is **Thriller**, followed by **SciFi** and **Fantasy/Romance**. The least seen movie genre is **History**. It appears that "pure" **Action** movies are rare, meaning that most of the action movies are categorized with another "main" genre. 

```{r 3.4, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}
# P2: Show the correlation between IMDb ratings and personal ratings
p2 <- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = rating_IMDb, y = rating_personal, colour = rating_personal)) + geom_jitter() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = c(1,3,5,7,9)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1,10), breaks = c(1,3,5,7,9)) +
  scale_color_continuous(low = "#D73027", high = "#1A9850") +
  labs(x = "IMDb ratings", y = "Personal ratings", title = "Correlation between \n IMDb and personal ratings") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 18),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.ticks = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "none", 
        legend.text = element_text(face = "italic", size = 10),
        legend.title = element_blank())
plot(p2)
```

It could be interesting to see the correlation between **personal ratings** and **IMDb average ratings**. To do so, we used `ggplot` to create a **scatter plot** with personal and website ratings. It is clear that, more or less, the personal ratings follow the pattern of IMDb ratings, with some exceptions (*highest vote for personal rating is 9, while on IMDb there are ratings higher than this value*). To better show the results we have used `geom_jitter` instead of the traditionla `geom_point`.
