## Project Overview

The final project will be a program which uses various parameters to select and propose a movie that you haven't seen yet. You can catalogue your previous movies watched to help the program to better select the results.

## R Functions list

* get_history
    * intial_history
    * suggestion_history
* get_mood_social_context
* get_date
* get_trend
    * imdb_updates
* sentiment_complete_analysis
    * sentiment_cluster
    
## Functions description

```{r cars}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
